# My Personal Project

**Project Proposal:**

- My project is in the form of a game where the user answers self inserted questions to fight monsters. The user will 
be able to choose between entering 1, 2, or 3 questions at a time in the form of monsters. For example, if the user 
chooses to add a small sized monster to the list of monsters they will be fighting, they will need to insert 1 question
into the quiz. Similarly, medium-sized monsters require 2 questions and large monsters require 3. Questions will pop up 
on the screen and when answered correctly, will attack the monster. When a monster is defeated, the user gains exp that 
helps them level up to keep track of their progress and moves onto another monster until there are no questions left. 
- Those who will use this application might be students who like to study by quizzing themselves or using flashcards 
and are looking for a fun way to review the information they've learnt, or students who are simply bored. I am 
interested in this idea because I enjoy playing video games and am also currently working on developing a game outside 
of school. I study by looking for ways to actively recall the information I've learnt as well, which is why I wanted to 
combine these two interests and habits in my personal project.
