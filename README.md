# My Personal Project

**Project Proposal:**

- My project is in the form of a game where the user answers multiple choice questions to fight monsters. The user will 
be able to choose between . Questions will pop up on the screen and when answered correctly, will attack the 
monster. When a monster is defeated, the user gains exp that helps them level up to keep track of their progress 
and moves onto another monster. 
- Those who will use this application might be students who like to study by quizzing themselves or using flashcards 
and are looking for a fun way to review the information they've learnt, or students who are simply bored. I am 
interested in this idea because I enjoy playing video games and am also currently working on developing a game outside 
of school. I study by looking for ways to actively recall the information I've learnt as well, which is why I wanted to 
combine these two interests and habits in my personal project. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add an arbitrary number of personalized questions into a quiz to 
practice on.
- As a user, I want to be able to study in a fun way. 
- As a user, I want to be able to learn when I am bored. 
- As a user, I want to be able to refresh my knowledge in a way that involves actively recalling information.
