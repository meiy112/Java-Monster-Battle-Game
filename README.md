# My Personal Project

**Project Proposal:**

- My project is in the form of a game where the user answers self inserted questions to fight monsters. The user will 
be able to choose between entering 1, 2, or 3 questions at a time in the form of monsters. For example, if the user 
chooses to add a small sized monster to the list of monsters they will be fighting, they will need to insert 1 question
into the quiz. Similarly, medium-sized monsters require 2 questions and large monsters require 3. Questions will pop up 
on the screen and when answered correctly, will allow the player to attack the monster. When a monster is defeated, the 
user gains exp that helps them level up to keep track of their progress and moves onto another monster until there are 
no questions left. Both the number of hits it takes to defeat a monster and the amount of exp that the player will
obtain after doing so varies depending on the size of the monster. 
- Those who will use this application might be students who like to study by quizzing themselves or using flashcards 
and are looking for a fun way to review the information they've learnt, or those who are simply bored. I am 
interested in this idea because I enjoy playing video games and am also currently working on developing a game outside 
of school. I also find it helpful to study by looking for ways to actively recall the information I've learnt, 
which is why I wanted to combine these two interests and studying habits in my personal project.
