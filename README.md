# My Personal Project

**Project Proposal:**

- My project is in the form of a game where the user answers multiple choice questions to fight boss battles. The
questions will be based off of the general knowledge learnt in some of the first year computer science courses at
UBC, such as *CPSC110* and *CPSC121*. Questions will pop up on the screen and when answered correctly, will deplete the 
health bar of the monster. When a monster is defeated, the user gains an achievement to keep track of their progress, 
and moves onto another monster with a different set of questions. 
- Those who will use this application might be UBC computer science students who are studying these subjects and are 
looking for a fun way to review the information they've learnt, or students who are simply bored. I am interested in 
this idea because I enjoy playing video games and am also currently working on developing a game outside of school. I 
really enjoyed the first year computer science courses I've taken at UBC as well, which is why I wanted to combine 
these two interests in my personal project. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my knowledge by adding an achievement to my progress log whenever I 
answer a set of questions correctly.
- As a user, I want to be able to study in a fun way. 
- As a user, I want to be able to learn when I am bored. 
- As a user, I want to be able to refresh my knowledge of CPSC courses.
